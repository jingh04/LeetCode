#Given an array of integers nums, you start with an initial positive value startValue.
#In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of startValue plus elements in nums (from left to right).
#Return the minimum positive value of startValue such that the step by step sum is never less than 1.

#Solution 1: my submission
class Solution:
    def minStartValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        MIN = nums[0]
        SUM = nums[0]
        for num in nums[1:]:
            SUM += num

                MIN = SUM
