#Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
#Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
#All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

#Solution 1:

    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if not s:
            return True
        dic = {}
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] not in dic:
                if t[i] in dic.values():
                    return False
                else:
                    dic[s[i]] = t[i]
            else:
                if dic[s[i]] != t[i]:
